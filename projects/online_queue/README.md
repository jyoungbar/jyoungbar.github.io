Features:
	-Users enter name upon landing using pop-up element
		-Users will also choose whether they are voting, active, or associate (can be verified by admin)
	-Users can edit their name at any time (although the number of times they have spoken must still be properly tracked)
	-User names (along with brother status) kept track in localstorage or sessionstorage (and/or on server)
		-maybe create rooms for each status, and emit most stuff to all rooms
	-Button leading to pop-up for logging in as admin (unless I go with checking IP address for admin)
	-Multiple queues open at once
	-Queue info stored in sessionstorage of admin (or possibly mongodb or just a server-side variable)
	-Max 3 queues per row
	-Button for admin to open/close new queue
	-(Maybe) History/record section that admin can add to and/or automatically updates for things like a motion passed, rule change, etc.
	-Admin can send out some sort of pop-up message
	-Robert's rules section
	-Some way for experience to be configured based on if this is a senate meeting or an APO meeting (either settings for admin to change or different endpoints on server or users choose when the land)
		-with this, there may be a need for admin to start and end meetings (can choose what type of meeting to start)
			-maybe have site allow for anyone to create a new meeting (which will be on its own endpoint) in which they are the admin
		-maybe have separate admin endpoint where admin can start/manage meetings

	Each queue should have:
		-title
		-list of people (kept track of using priority queue object)
		-section with button to join/leave queue
		-voting capabilities (upon release of admin)
			-when a vote is opened, a pop-up will appear for users to cast their vote
			-while voting is open, number of people who have voted will be shown out of people who can vote
			-will need to distinguish between voting members, active, and associate brothers
				-admin should be able to choose who is allowed to vote when opening a vote
			-use recharts or something to create graphs of voting results
			-voting will close either once everyone has voted or admin closes voting
		-buttons for admin to remove, add, or otherwise edit queue
		-time that the queue started
